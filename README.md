# The Little Schemer - Exercises

The [Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992) is a wonderful book. It teaches the fundamentals of lisp while easing the mind through recursive reps. The book is written in a koan style and is very easy to follow. Because I am the type that learns more by doing, I have chosen to write code for koans while reading.
