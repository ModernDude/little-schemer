# The Little Schemer - Learn By Doing

[The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992) is a wonderful book. It teaches the fundamentals of lisp while easing the mind through recursion. The book starts with simple list processing and finishes with the implementation of a lisp interpreter.

This repo is my attempt to better understand the content by writing unit tests for the code in this book. Note that these tests are not intended to exhaustively test the code. The real purpose is to serve as a rack to hang my explorative coat on.

Next up, [The Seasoned Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/Seasoned-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/026256100X)

## Tech Notes

* Unit Tests written using [Test Manager](http://web.mit.edu/~axch/www/test_manager.html) Unit Test framework for Scheme.
* Running on [MIT/GNU Scheme](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme) environment.
